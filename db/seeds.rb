  {title: "Free web design and development tutorials", lead: "Now days, there are so many free resources to help people start learning to code.", content: "<p>I've compiled a few links here that you may not be aware of.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>HTML and CSS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Shay Howe has produced two amazing guides for beginners to learn HTML and CSS - a beginners and advanced guide. Although not tutorials as such, they are easy to read through and learn from the start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://learn.shayhowe.com/\" target=\"_blank\">A practical guide to HTML & CSS</a></p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/sdcpostimages/codeacademy.png\" />\r\n\r\n<p>CodeAcademy is the hottest new coding education startup and they have a great Web Fundamentals course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web</a></p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/sdcpostimages/moz.png\" />\r\n<p>Mozilla, the makers of the Firefox browser, also provides great lessons at an introductory level and advanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/html\" target=\"_blank\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/html</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While you're learning HTML and practicing building web pages, you might like to try out this script which highlights errors in your code - it helps by identifying which tags you are missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://kev.inburke.com/kevin/helping-you-get-html-right/\" target=\"_blank\">http://kev.inburke.com/kevin/helping-you-get-html-right/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Interface Design</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It's great to be proficient in HTML & CSS but design is a very important part of web development as it can determine the success or failure of your website or app.</p>\r\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/sdcpostimages/hackdesign.png\" />\r\n<p>The people at Hackdesign.org provide a great email tutorial that I really recommend you sign up for and progress through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://hackdesign.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://hackdesign.org/</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few free tutorials to help you get started with Rails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Hartl's is probably the most famous. He starts you right at the beginning with setting up your development environment and teaches you how to build a Twitter clone app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book\" target=\"_blank\">http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book</a></p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/sdcpostimages/railsapps.png\" />\r\n<p>RailsApps is a great tutorial source - although they have started charging for their more advanced classes. They also provide a great tool for instantly creating a simple boilerplate site - RailsComposer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on one of the tutorials and then sign up for the free account: <a href=\"https://tutorials.railsapps.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://tutorials.railsapps.org/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>O'Reilly publishing has also made available the ‘beta' version of “Rails 3 in a Nutshell\" free online. It is a great introductory book which covers the basics of the latest version of Rails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596521424/\" target=\"_blank\">http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596521424/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/sdcpostimages/railsguides.png\" />\r\n<p>The official Rails website also provides a great guide: <a href=\"http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Javascript</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>CodeAcademy is again the go-to place for free Javascript lessons. Learning in this practical way definitely gives you a good feel for Javascript but doesn't necessarily help you feel confident going off on your own and producing web apps with it. Check out the jQuery, JavaScript and Projects tutorials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/learn\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.codecademy.com/learn</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Source Control</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>An important tool in a developer's working life is source control - helping teams merge their code safely as well as providing a backup and recovery mechanism. However it can be challenging to pick up the ideas and workings of source control systems to begin with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new site has just been released, inspired by the CodeAcademy method of learning by doing, this tutorial will help you start to get a grip of the concepts behind source control systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pcottle.github.com/learnGitBranching/\" target=\"_blank\">http://pcottle.github.com/learnGitBranching/</a></p>", image: "Screen_Shot_2013-08-20_at_11.56.07_PM.png", publish: true, slug: "free-web-design-and-development-turorials", user_id: 1}
